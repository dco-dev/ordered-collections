# Algorithms

## Weight-Balanced Trees

Each node stores a key, value, left and right children, and **subtree weight** (= 1 + size(left) + size(right)). Specialized node types exist for performance: `LongKeyNode` (unboxed `long` key), `DoubleKeyNode` (unboxed `double` key), and `IntervalNode` (additional max-endpoint field for interval augmentation).

These are not separate tree implementations. The library uses one shared tree
algebra, parameterized by two hooks: `order/*compare*` for ordering semantics
and `*t-join*` for node reconstruction. Collection constructors bind those at
the boundary, so the same split/join/search code serves generic nodes,
primitive-specialized nodes, and augmented variants.

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  key: 50        │
        │  val: "fifty"   │
        │  weight: 7      │
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
      ┌──────────┴──────────┐
      ▼                     ▼
 ┌─────────┐          ┌─────────┐
 │ key: 25 │          │ key: 75 │
 │ wt: 3   │          │ wt: 3   │
 └────┬────┘          └────┬────┘
      │                    │
   ┌──┴──┐              ┌──┴──┐
   ▼     ▼              ▼     ▼
 [10]   [30]          [60]   [90]
 wt:1   wt:1          wt:1   wt:1
```

Leaves are a sentinel value (weight 0). The weight field serves double duty: it *is* the balance invariant and it enables O(log n) positional access.

## Balance Invariant

Hirai-Yamamoto parameters (δ=3, γ=2):

```
weight(left)  + 1 ≤ δ × (weight(right) + 1)
weight(right) + 1 ≤ δ × (weight(left)  + 1)
```

No subtree can be more than 3× its sibling's weight. When violated, `stitch-wb` applies a single or double rotation:

- **Single rotation** when the heavy child's *outer* subtree dominates (checked via γ)
- **Double rotation** when the heavy child's *inner* subtree dominates

```
Single right:                Double right:
       [C]       [A]              [C]           [B]
      /   \     /   \            /   \         /   \
    [A]    z  x    [C]         [A]    z      [A]   [C]
   /   \          /   \       /   \         /  \   /  \
  x    [B]      [B]    z    w    [B]       w   x  y   z
                                /   \
                               x     y
```

Hirai & Yamamoto (2011) proved using Coq that (δ=3, γ=2) is the unique integer parameter pair guaranteeing O(log n) height and correct rebalancing for all insert/delete sequences. Height bound: ≤ log₃/₂ n ≈ 1.71 log₂ n.

## Split and Join

Everything reduces to these two primitives.

**Split** divides a tree at a key into (left, found, right):

```
split(tree, 50):

         [40]
        /    \
     [20]    [60]
     /  \    /  \
   [10][30][50][80]

            ↓

 LEFT (<50)       FOUND     RIGHT (>50)
    [40]            50          [60]
    /  \                          \
 [20]  [30]                       [80]
  /
[10]
```

**Join** (`node-concat3`) combines two trees with a pivot key, rebalancing as needed. When the trees are similarly sized, the pivot becomes the root directly. When one side is much heavier, join walks down the heavy side until it finds a subtree of comparable weight, inserts the pivot there, and rebalances upward.

```
join(left, 50, right):

 LEFT           RIGHT             [50]
  [25]           [75]            /    \
  /  \           /  \    →    [25]    [75]
[10] [30]     [60] [90]      /  \    /  \
                            [10][30][60][90]
```

**Join without pivot** (`node-concat2`) extracts the greatest element from the left tree and uses it as the pivot for `node-concat3`. Used by intersection and difference when the split key is absent.

Both split and join are O(log n). The key property of weight-balanced trees: weight composes trivially — `weight(join(L, k, R)) = weight(L) + 1 + weight(R)` — so no auxiliary recomputation (height, color) is needed after joining. This gives WBTs lower constant factors for split/join than AVL or red-black trees.

Because `join` is also the representation hook, the same recursive algorithms
rebuild the correct node type automatically. Different collection variants
inherit the same operation structure while choosing different storage or
augmentation behavior at node construction time.

## Enumerators: The Fundamental Traversal Interface

Below split/join, the tree's basic traversal primitive is the **enumerator**.
An enumerator is a compact explicit traversal state: a chain of frames
representing the current node plus the remaining path to the next node in
sorted order.

The forward enumerator descends the left spine:

```
node-enumerator(root)
  = [current-node | continuation]
```

Advancing the enumerator does two things:
- if the current node has a right subtree, descend that subtree's left spine
- otherwise, resume from the saved continuation

The reverse enumerator is symmetric: descend the right spine, then resume
outward through saved continuations.

Why this matters:
- it gives in-order traversal without recursion or lazy-seq allocation in the hot path
- it is the common substrate for `node-reduce`, `node-fold-left`, `node-fold-right`, sequence construction, and tree-to-tree linear merges
- it keeps traversal mechanics separate from collection presentation (`seq`, `rseq`, key seqs, entry seqs)

This is close in spirit to Oleg Kiselyov's "Towards the best collection API:
A design of the overall optimal collection traversal interface", which argues
for enumerator-style traversal as the fundamental collection-walking primitive.
The tree code applies that idea at the node level and then builds the public
seq/reduce interfaces on top of it.

Conceptually, the layering is:

```
enumerator         ; explicit tree-walk state
  ↓
node-reduce        ; eager traversal API
node-seq / direct seq types
  ↓
collection seq/reduce interfaces
```

This is why the tree code treats enumerators as fundamental rather than as a
small helper for `seq`. They are the shared low-level traversal interface from
which both eager reduction and Clojure-facing sequence behavior are derived.

## The Join-Based Paradigm

All tree operations reduce to split and join (Adams 1992, Blelloch et al. 2016):

| Operation | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| insert(k, v) | split at k, join with new node |
| delete(k) | split at k, join left and right |
| union(A, B) | split A at root(B), recurse on halves, join |
| intersection(A, B) | split A at root(B), recurse, join if found, concat if not |
| difference(A, B) | split A at root(B), recurse, concat halves |

Balance logic lives only in join. All operations inherit O(log n) balancing automatically.

## Set Operations

Union, intersection, and difference use Adams' divide-and-conquer:

```
union(T₁, T₂):
  if T₁ empty: return T₂
  if T₂ empty: return T₁
  (k, v) = root(T₂)
  (L₁, _, R₁) = split(T₁, k)
  return join(union(L₁, left(T₂)), k, v, union(R₁, right(T₂)))

intersection(T₁, T₂):
  if T₁ empty or T₂ empty: return ∅
  (k, v) = root(T₂)
  (L₁, present, R₁) = split(T₁, k)
  L = intersection(L₁, left(T₂))
  R = intersection(R₁, right(T₂))
  if present: return join(L, k, v, R)
  else:       return concat(L, R)

difference(T₁, T₂):
  if T₁ empty: return ∅
  if T₂ empty: return T₁
  (k, _) = root(T₂)
  (L₁, _, R₁) = split(T₁, k)
  return concat(difference(L₁, left(T₂)), difference(R₁, right(T₂)))
```

**Work complexity:** O(m log(n/m + 1)) where m ≤ n. This is information-theoretically optimal — it matches the comparison-based lower bound. When m ≪ n (e.g., merging a small set into a large one), this approaches O(m log n). When m ≈ n, it's O(n). The naive element-by-element insertion approach is always O(m log n), which is worse when m is large.

### Parallelism

The two recursive calls in each operation are independent. The implementation forks the left recursion as a `ForkJoinTask` and computes the right recursion inline, then joins:

```
fork-join:
  left-task  = fork(union(L₁, left(T₂)))   ← submitted to ForkJoinPool
  right-result = union(R₁, right(T₂))       ← computed inline
  left-result  = left-task.join()            ← wait for fork
  return join(left-result, k, v, right-result)
```

The current implementation uses operation-specific root thresholds:
- union: `131,072`
- intersection: `65,536`
- difference: `131,072`
- ordered-map merge: `65,536`

Below those root thresholds, the operations stay sequential. Once in the
parallel path, recursive splits re-fork at `65,536`, subject to the branch-shape
guard described below. Tiny subtrees still use the direct sequential cutoff of
`64`.

Span is O(log² n), giving near-linear speedup on many cores (Blelloch et al. 2016).

## Fork-Join Parallelism

Six operations use Java's `ForkJoinPool` for automatic parallelism: union, intersection, difference, merge-with, and two forms of parallel fold. Set operations use the three-layer fork-join pattern directly; fold delegates to `clojure.core.reducers/fold`.

### The pattern

Every parallel operation has three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Entry point                                                │
│  Is the caller already in a ForkJoinPool worker thread?     │
│    yes → call par-fn directly                               │
│    no  → submit par-fn to the common pool via .invoke       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  par-fn (parallel recursion)                                │
│  Is the subtree large enough to justify forking?            │
│    yes → fork left subtree, compute right inline, join      │
│    no  → call seq-fn                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  seq-fn (sequential recursion)                              │
│  Same algorithm, no fork overhead                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why the pool entry point is needed

`ForkJoinTask.fork()` can only be called from within a `ForkJoinPool` worker thread. When user code calls `union` from a regular thread (e.g. the main thread or a core.async thread), the operation must first be submitted to the pool. Once inside the pool, recursive calls are already on worker threads and can fork directly:

```
(if (ForkJoinTask/inForkJoinPool)
  (par-fn root)                          ;; already inside pool
  (.invoke fork-join-pool                ;; enter pool
    (ForkJoinTask/adapt (fn [] (par-fn root)))))
```

### Task representation

The hot recursive path no longer goes through `Callable` plus
`ForkJoinTask/adapt`, and it no longer relies on repeated dynamic-var rebinding.
Instead, the sequential and parallel kernels use explicit-argument helpers
(`cmp`, `create`) and fork a small internal `RecursiveTask` wrapper.

That matters because the set-algebra recursion is fine-grained: if task
creation, comparator rebinding, or closure allocation are too expensive, the
practical crossover climbs far above where the algorithm should pay off.

### Threshold tuning

Parallelism uses four guards to keep fork overhead from dominating:

| Threshold | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `union` root threshold | 131,072 | Enter parallel union only above this combined subtree size |
| `intersection` root threshold | 65,536 | Enter parallel intersection only above this combined subtree size |
| `difference` root threshold | 131,072 | Enter parallel difference only above this combined subtree size |
| `merge` root threshold | 65,536 | Enter parallel ordered-map merge only above this combined subtree size |
| recursive threshold | 65,536 | Once already in the parallel path, re-fork only above this combined subtree size |
| `+parallel-min-branch+` | 65,536 | Only fork when both recursive branches are substantive enough |
| `+sequential-cutoff+` | 64 | Subtree size below which set operations use direct linear merge |
| `+min-fold-chunk-size+` | 4,096 | Minimum chunk size for parallel fold (floor on user-supplied value) |

The root thresholds are operation-specific because one conservative value left
too many practical wins on the table. Union and difference reconstruct more
output than intersection; merge behaves differently again; comparator cost and
tree shape also matter. The fold chunk floor prevents excessive O(log n) tree
splits when `r/fold`'s default chunk size (512) would create too many chunks.

`parallel_threshold_bench.clj` is useful for local tuning, but it does not
produce one stable crossover point across machines. In the April 2, 2026
reruns, the production-path benchmark favored per-operation entry thresholds
plus a lower recursive threshold and a branch-shape guard. That matches the
actual workload differences between union, intersection, difference, and
ordered-map merge more closely than a single universal threshold.

### Operations using this pattern

**Set operations** (union, intersection, difference, merge-with): The tree's divide-and-conquer structure maps directly to fork-join. Split T₁ at T₂'s root, fork the left halves, compute the right halves inline, join results. Work O(m log(n/m + 1)), span O(log² n).

**Parallel fold** (`node-chunked-fold`): Split the tree into roughly equal subtrees using `node-split` at evenly-spaced positions, then fold them in parallel via `r/fold`. Splitting is done eagerly in the caller's thread (where dynamic bindings are available); each chunk's sequential reduce uses `node-reduce` which needs no bindings. Work O(n), span O(n/p + k log n) where k is the number of chunks.

## Positional Access

Weight at each node enables O(log n) index operations without any additional data structure.

### nth (index → element)

```
nth(tree, i):
  left-size = weight(left)
  if i < left-size:  recurse into left
  if i == left-size: return this node
  else:              recurse into right with i' = i - left-size - 1
```

### rank (element → index)

Accumulate left subtree sizes while descending:

```
rank(tree, key):
  acc = 0
  if key < node.key: recurse left, keep acc
  if key = node.key: return acc + weight(left)
  if key > node.key: acc += weight(left) + 1, recurse right
```

### Derived operations

- **slice(start, end)**: split-at start, split-at (end - start) on the right half
- **median**: nth at ⌊n/2⌋
- **percentile(p)**: nth at ⌊n × p / 100⌋

All O(log n). Available on `ordered-set`, `ordered-map`, `fuzzy-set`, `fuzzy-map`.

## Nearest (Floor / Ceiling)

`ordered-set` and `ordered-map` implement directional nearest-neighbor via tree descent:

| Test | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `:<=` | floor — greatest element ≤ k |
| `:<` | predecessor — greatest element < k |
| `:>=` | ceiling — least element ≥ k |
| `:>` | successor — least element > k |

Standard BST descent with candidate tracking. O(log n).

## Parallel Fold

Collections implement `clojure.core.reducers/CollFold` via `node-chunked-fold`. The tree is split into roughly equal chunks using `node-split`; those chunks are then folded in parallel by `clojure.core.reducers/fold`.

Minimum chunk size: **`+min-fold-chunk-size+` = 4,096**. User-supplied chunk sizes below that floor are rounded up to avoid excessive tree splitting overhead.

Span is approximately O(n/p + k log n), where `p` is processor count and `k` is the number of chunks.

## Interval Tree Augmentation

`IntervalNode` adds a field `z`: the maximum right endpoint in the subtree. This is maintained during rotations — each node's `z` is the max of its own interval's endpoint and its children's `z` values.

```
      ┌─────────────────────┐
      │  interval: [3,7]    │
      │  max-end: 15        │  ← max of all endpoints in subtree
      └─────────┬───────────┘
                │
     ┌──────────┴──────────┐
     ▼                     ▼
┌─────────┐          ┌─────────┐
│ [1,5]   │          │ [8,15]  │
│ max: 5  │          │ max: 15 │
└────┬────┘          └────┬────┘
     │                    │
  ┌──┴──┐              ┌──┴──┐
  ▼     ▼              ▼     ▼
[0,2] [4,6]         [6,10] [12,15]
max:2 max:6         max:10 max:15
```

### Query algorithm

The implementation supports both point queries and interval-vs-interval overlap queries. Given a query interval `i`:

```
search(node, i):
  if leaf: return

  # Search right if query's endpoint ≥ node's start point
  if b(i) >= a(node.key):
    search(right, i)

  # Check current node for intersection
  if intersects?(i, node.key):
    collect(node)

  # Search left only if query's start ≤ max endpoint in left subtree
  if a(i) <= left.z:
    search(left, i)
```

`intersects?` checks for any common point between two intervals (overlap, containment in either direction). The `z` field enables pruning: if `left.z < a(query)`, no interval in the left subtree can overlap the query.

Complexity: O(log n + k) where k = number of matching intervals.

Point queries are a special case: a point `p` is treated as the interval `[p, p]`.

## Range Map

`range-map` enforces non-overlapping ranges. Each point maps to exactly one value. Ranges are half-open: `[lo, hi)`.

### Insert (assoc)

Inserting `[25, 75) → :new` into a tree containing `[0, 100) → :a`:

```
Step 1: Find all ranges overlapping [25, 75)
  → [[0, 100) → :a]

Step 2: Remove overlapping ranges from tree

Step 3: Re-insert trimmed portions outside [25, 75)
  → [0, 25) → :a,  [75, 100) → :a

Step 4: Insert new range
  → [0, 25) → :a,  [25, 75) → :new,  [75, 100) → :a
```

### Coalescing insert (assoc-coalescing)

When adjacent ranges have the same value, merge them:

```
Before: [0, 50) → :a    [50, 100) → :a   (two ranges)
Insert [100, 150) → :a with coalescing:
After:  [0, 50) → :a    [50, 150) → :a   (adjacent merged)
```

Complexity: O(k log n) where k = number of overlapping/adjacent ranges.

## Segment Tree

Each `AggregateNode` stores a pre-computed aggregate (`agg`) of its entire subtree under a user-specified associative operation. Created via a custom node constructor that computes `agg = op(left.agg, op(value, right.agg))` at every node.

```
                ┌─────────────┐
                │ key: 3      │
                │ val: 40     │
                │ agg: 150 ◄──────── sum of entire tree
                └──────┬──────┘
           ┌───────────┴───────────┐
    ┌──────┴──────┐         ┌──────┴──────┐
    │ key: 1      │         │ key: 4      │
    │ val: 20     │         │ val: 50     │
    │ agg: 30     │         │ agg: 80     │
    └──────┬──────┘         └──────┬──────┘
           │                       │
    ┌──────┴──────┐         ┌──────┴──────┐
    │ key: 0      │         │ key: 5      │
    │ val: 10     │         │ val: 30     │
    │ agg: 10     │         │ agg: 30     │
    └─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
```

### Range query

Two implementations: `query-range` (basic) and `query-range-fast` (uses subtree bounds to short-circuit).

```
query-range-fast(node, lo, hi):
  if leaf: return identity

  # Find subtree's actual key range
  l-lo = min key in left subtree (or node.key if left is leaf)
  r-hi = max key in right subtree (or node.key if right is leaf)

  # Entire subtree outside range
  if r-hi < lo or l-lo > hi: return identity

  # Entire subtree inside range → use pre-computed aggregate!
  if lo ≤ l-lo and r-hi ≤ hi: return node.agg

  # Partial overlap → recurse
  L = query-range-fast(left, lo, hi)
  V = node.val if lo ≤ node.key ≤ hi, else identity
  R = query-range-fast(right, lo, hi)
  return op(L, op(V, R))
```

The key optimization: when a subtree is entirely within the query range, return its `agg` directly instead of recursing. This gives O(log n) for both queries and updates.

## Fuzzy Lookup

Fuzzy collections find the closest element by distance. The algorithm uses split:

```
find-nearest(tree, query):
  (left, exact, right) = split(tree, query)

  if exact: return exact

  floor   = greatest(left)    ← O(log n)
  ceiling = least(right)      ← O(log n)

  return argmin(|query - floor|, |query - ceiling|)
```

When equidistant, a configurable tiebreaker (`:< ` or `:>`) determines preference. The `distance-fn` is also configurable (defaults to numeric absolute difference).

**Invariant:** The nearest element by distance is always a sort-order neighbor (floor or ceiling), so split gives us the only two candidates. O(log n).

## Handling Duplicates

`ordered-multiset` and `priority-queue` allow duplicate keys by appending an internal sequence counter.

**Multiset** stores `[value, seqnum]` pairs. Comparison: first by value, then by seqnum. This gives stable insertion order for equal values and FIFO behavior on removal.

**Priority queue** stores `[priority, seqnum, value]` triples. Sorted by priority first, then seqnum. `peek` returns the minimum-priority element; among equal priorities, the earliest inserted.

## Complexity Summary

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Lookup | O(log n) | All collections |
| Insert / Delete | O(log n) | Persistent (path copying) |
| nth / rank | O(log n) | Via subtree weights |
| median / percentile | O(log n) | Via nth |
| nearest (floor/ceiling) | O(log n) | Ordered sets and maps |
| Split (by key or index) | O(log n) | |
| Join | O(log n) | Universal primitive |
| Union / Intersection / Difference | O(m log(n/m+1)) | Work-optimal, fork-join parallel |
| Parallel fold | O(n/p + log²n) | p = processors |
| Interval query | O(log n + k) | k = result count |
| Range-map assoc | O(k log n) | k = overlapping ranges |
| Segment-tree query | O(log n) | Pre-computed aggregates |
| Fuzzy lookup | O(log n) | Split + floor/ceiling |
